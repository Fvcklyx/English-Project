You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
And I hung my head and cried

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

I'll always love you and make you happy
If you will only say the same
But if you leave me to love another
You'll regret it all some day

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

You told me once dear, you really loved me
And no one else dear, could come between
But now you've left me and love another
You have shattered all my dreams

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

          <h2>Rewrite The Stars</h2>
          <pre class="songLyrics">
You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
I know you want me
So don't keep saying our hands are tied

You claim it's not in the cards
And fate is pulling you miles away
And out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide 
that you're my destiny?

What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
Maybe the world could be ours, tonight

You think it's easy
You think I don't want to run to you
But there are mountains
And there are doors 
that we can't walk through
I know you're wondering why
Because we're able to be just you and me, 
within these walls
But when we go outside
You're gonna wake up and see 
that it was hopeless after all

No one can rewrite the stars
How can you say you'll be mine?
Everything keeps us apart
And I'm not the one you were meant to find
It's not up to you, it's not up to me
When everyone tells us what we can be
How can we rewrite the stars?
Say that the world can be ours, tonight

All I want is to fly with you
All I want is to fall with you
So just give me all of you
It feels impossible (it's not impossible)
Is it impossible? Say that it's possible

How do we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing can keep us apart
'Cause you are the one I was meant to find
It's up to you, and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
Why don't we rewrite the stars?
Changing the world to be ours

You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
But I can't have you
We're bound to break and my hands are tied

          <h2>Brown Eyes</h2>
          <pre class="songLyrics">
Remember the first day when I saw your face?
Remember the first day when you smiled at me?
You stepped to me and then you said to me
I was the woman you dreamed about

Remember the first day when you called my house?
Remember the first day when you took me out?
We had butterflies, although we tried to hide
And we both had a beautiful night

The way we held each other's hand
The way we talked, the way we laughed
It felt so good to find true love
I knew right then and there you were the one,
ooh

I know that he loves me 'cause he told me so
I know that he loves me 'cause his feelings show
When he stares at me, you see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love

I know that he loves me 'cause it's obvious
I know that he loves me 'cause it's me he trusts
And he's missing me if he's not kissing me
And when he looks at me, his brown eyes tell it so

Remember the first day, the first day we kissed?
Remember the first day we had an argument?
We apologized and then we compromised
And we haven't argued since

Remember the first day we stopped playing games?
Remember the first day you fell in love with me?
It felt so good for you to say those words
'Cause I felt the same way too

The way we held each other's hands
The way we talked, the way we laughed
It felt so good to fall in love
And I knew right there and then 
that you were the one, ooh, oh

I know that he loves me 'cause he told me so
I know that he loves me 'cause his feelings show
When he stares at me, you see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love

I know that he loves me 'cause it's obvious
I know that he loves me 'cause it's me he trusts
And he's missing me if he's not kissing me
And when he looks at me, 
his brown eyes tell it so

I'm so happy, so happy that you're in my life
And baby, now that you're a part of me
You've shown me
Shown me the true meaning of love 
(the true meaning of love)
And I know he loves me

I know that he loves me 'cause he told me so
I know that he loves me 'cause his feelings show
When he stares at me, you see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love

I know that he loves me 'cause it's obvious
I know that he loves me 'cause it's me he trusts
And he's missing me if he's not kissing me
And when he looks at me, his brown eyes tell it so

He looks at me and his brown eyes tell it so

Today, I don't feel like doing anything

Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gon' tell me I can't, nah
I'll be lounging on the couch, 
just chillin' in my Snuggie
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle, I'm the freaking man
